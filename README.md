# DREAM Challenge Toronto 2015
## Drug Combination Prediction

### Data

#### From DREAM

Dose response curves
* per compound
* per cell line
* for combinations (provide training set for learning algorithm)

Molecules
* molecular weight
* solubility
* chemical fragments
* shape
* QSAR

Genomic
* CNVs (copy number variations)
    * parts of genome are {duplicated|lost}
    * changes in expression levels -> gene dosage effects
    * most important for gene loss
* SNPs - structural, splice sites, regulation

Methylation
* histones -> expression

#### External Data

Epistatic interactions
* A or B by itself not effective, need to stop both
* Pathway C might regulate/interact with A/B

Network data
* pathways (priority to pathways involved in cancer?)
    * cell growth
    * genome stability
    * loss of contact inhibition
    * metastasis
* PPi
* co-expression data (quantitative relationships b/w proteins and genes)

### Sub-Challenge 1
